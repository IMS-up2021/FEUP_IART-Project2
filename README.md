# Supervised Learning - Breast Cancer prediction

## Introduction

### About the Dataset
The dataset of this project is from [Kaggle's Breast Cancer Data Page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adhamelkomy/breast-cancer). The dataset includes a variety of features computed from the images, including measurements of cell shape, texture, and size, as well as information about the patient's age and final diagnosis (benign (B) or malignant (M)).

### About the Problem
The aim of this project is to forecast whether a cancer biopsy indicates a benign or malignant condition. It involves a binary classification task, with the diagnosis serving as the target variable, denoted as either benign or malignant.

### Solution
To tackle this issue, we'll employ a supervised learning approach, using the dataset outlined previously. We'll train a model using the training set and subsequently assess its performance using the test set. Evaluation will be based on the accuracy metric, representing the proportion of accurate predictions made by the model.

### How to run

Open the [breast_cancer_model.ipynb](breast_cancer_model.ipynb) file in Jupyter Notebook or the IDE of your choice and run the cells. The rest of the instructions and comments are on the notebook.
